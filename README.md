This is a clone of [AssemblyLine](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.olympus.assemblyline&hl=en&gl=US), an android game about building factories.
See the [reddit page](https://www.reddit.com/r/AssemblyLineGame/) for more information about the game.

## How to play
This project is in development, so there is no official release. To play the game, load the project in unity 2021.1.10f1 (or compatible) and execute.

## Objective
My first objective is to learn Unity and have some fun with this game.

My project aims to be somewhat different from the original game:
* raw materials cost 80 (identical buy&sell price)
* splitter and selector machines allow materials coming from their back only
* some quite useless machines are dismissed (robotic arms, transporter, timed roller)
* one floor only
* play modes: sandbox and weekly challenge

## Current status
The project is in early development but the game is playable in sandbox mode. All artifacts and required machines are implemented.

## Thanks
